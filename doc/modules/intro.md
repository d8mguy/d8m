## About Modules Documentation

The directories here contain markdown files for each "official" module in the release, organized into rough catgories. It is my intention in the near future to develop code for extracting the documentation here from source code, along the lines of Go's document generation tools. Therefore, although the content of the documentation released here should be correct and reasonably complete, it is quite deficient in the area of easy access via links, indexes, etc.
