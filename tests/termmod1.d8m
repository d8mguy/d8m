// termmod1. Check that adding an item to a variant list works.
// See notes around 08/17/22 and 09/09/22. D8m semantics says that the pushb to fcptArgs should affect trm.arg since
// they're the same entity. This can work by taking pointers but you can't take pointers to an interface type in go.
// A hack in pass1 of cleanup causes fcptArgs to be substd by its binding so this test works. But it's not a completely
// correct implementation.
